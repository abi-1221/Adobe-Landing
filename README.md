# Adobe Creative Cloud Pro Plus Landing Page

This is a premium, single-page landing page for the Adobe Creative Cloud Pro Plus offer.

## Deployment

Since the `vercel` CLI is not installed in this environment, you can deploy this site completely free using Vercel's web interface:

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
2. Drag the `adobe-promo-landing` folder into the "Import Git Repository" section (it works for local folders too if you install the Vercel CLI locally, or use the "Upload" feature if supported).
3. **Better yet:** Push this repository to your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
   - Create a new repo on GitHub.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Then import that repo on [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).

### Option 2: Netlify Drop
1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Drag the `adobe-promo-landing` folder onto the page.
3. It will deploy instantly.
